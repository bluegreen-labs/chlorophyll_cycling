# Chlorophyll cycling model

Reproducible [worked example](https://bluegreen-labs.github.io/chlorophyll_cycling/articles/calibration_uncertainty_analysis.html) of a pigment mass balance model for leaf senescence timing.

- Data gathering and pre-processing scripts are stored with raw data in `data-raw` and should be executed sequentially
  - final model input is stored in `data`
- A demo analysis is provided in the `analysis` folder, buffering model optimization 
  - output is stored in `data`
- the report is rendered on github from the vignette and buffered data
  - vignettes are stored in the `vignettes` folder
  - can be rendered locally (using knitr or pkgdown)
